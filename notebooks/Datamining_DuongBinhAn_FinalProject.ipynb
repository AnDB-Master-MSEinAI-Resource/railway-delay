    "# 1) Introduction — Background, Objectives, and Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Problem Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Train delays are a critical operational challenge that impacts multiple facets of railway systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operational Impact**: Delays affect dispatching and scheduling operations, requiring real-time adjustments to maintain service reliability.\n",
    "- **Passenger Experience**: Unpredictable delays diminish customer satisfaction and trust in rail services.\n",
    "- **Resource Optimization**: Inefficient allocation of locomotives and carriages occurs when delays are not accurately anticipated.\n",
    "- **Downstream Connections**: Delay propagation affects connecting services, creating cascading disruptions across the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Railway operational data exhibits unique characteristics:\n",
    "- **Temporal Nature**: Data is inherently time-dependent, with strong temporal correlations between consecutive observations.\n",
    "- **Chain Effect**: Delays often propagate along routes or across consecutive train services, creating interdependencies that must be captured in predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and predicting train delays enables proactive decision-making, improved resource allocation, and enhanced passenger communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project pursues two complementary analytical approaches to address the railway delay problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Regression (Primary Task — Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Predict the magnitude of train delays measured in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: `DELAY_MINUTES` (or `TARGET` representing delay in minutes)\n",
    "- **Output**: Continuous prediction of delay duration\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Enables precise scheduling adjustments, resource reallocation, and detailed passenger information\n",
    "- **Business Value**: Supports quantitative operational decisions and optimization algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Classification (Supporting Task — Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Predict whether a train will be delayed based on a business-defined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: `IS_DELAYED` (binary: 0 = on-time, 1 = delayed)\n",
    "- **Threshold Definition**: Commonly set at delays exceeding 5 or 10 minutes, depending on operational standards\n",
    "- **Output**: \n",
    "  - Probability of delay occurrence\n",
    "  - Binary delay classification label\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Facilitates alerting systems, early warning mechanisms, and binary decision-making\n",
    "- **Business Value**: Enables proactive interventions and resource mobilization\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Recommendation**: Prioritize the **regression task** as the primary analysis to capture the full spectrum of delay severity. The classification task can complement this by providing binary alerts and supporting threshold-based operational policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear evaluation metrics are essential to assess model performance and determine project success:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Task Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes large prediction errors, suitable when extreme delays are particularly costly\n",
    "  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Provides interpretable average prediction error in minutes\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Evaluation Protocol**: \n",
    "  - Use **time-based test set** (chronological split) to simulate real-world deployment\n",
    "  - Avoid random shuffling to preserve temporal integrity\n",
    "  - Report metrics separately for different delay ranges (e.g., short delays < 10 min vs. long delays > 30 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Task Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve)**: Preferred over ROC-AUC when dealing with imbalanced delay classes\n",
    "  - **F₂ Score**: Emphasizes recall over precision (β=2), appropriate when the business priority is to **detect as many delayed trains as possible**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Rationale for F₂ Score**:\n",
    "  - The F_β score is defined as: \n",
    "    $$F_\\beta = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{\\text{precision} \\cdot \\text{recall}}{(\\beta^2 \\cdot \\text{precision}) + \\text{recall}}$$\n",
    "  - With **β = 2**, recall is weighted **twice as much** as precision\n",
    "  - This aligns with operational objectives where **missing a delayed train (false negative) is more costly** than falsely predicting a delay (false positive)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Additional Considerations**:\n",
    "  - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Critical for ensuring comprehensive delay detection\n",
    "  - **Precision**: Balances false alarm rates to maintain operational credibility\n",
    "  - **Threshold Optimization**: Adjust classification threshold to achieve desired precision-recall trade-off\n",
    "\n",

    "| **Classification** | PR-AUC, F₂ Score | Time-based test split | Maximize F₂ (prioritize recall) |\n",
